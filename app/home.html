<em><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto' target="_blank">From Wikipedia:</a>
    <p>
        Esperanto is the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language. It was created by
        Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof in 1887, when he published a book detailing the
        language, Unua Libro ("First Book"), under the pseudonym "Dr. Esperanto". The word esperanto translates
        into
        English as "one who hopes".
    </p>
    <p>
        Zamenhof's goal was to create an easy and flexible language that would serve as a universal second
        language
        to foster world peace and international understanding, and to build a community of speakers, as he
        believed
        that one could not have a language without such a community.
    </p>
    <p>
        His original title for the language was simply "the international language" (lingvo internacia), but
        early
        speakers grew fond of the name Esperanto and began to use it as the name for the language just two years
        after its creation; the name quickly gained prominence and has been used as an official name ever
        since.
    </p>
    <p>Zamenhof had three goals, as he wrote in Unua Libro:
        <ol>
            <li>"To render the study of the language so easy as to make its acquisition mere play to the
                learner."</li><br />
            <li>"To enable the learner to make direct use of his knowledge with people of any nationality,
                whether the language be universally accepted or not; in other words, the language is to be
                directly a means of international communication."</li><br />
            <li>"To find some means of overcoming the natural indifference of mankind, and disposing them, in
                the quickest manner possible, and en masse, to learn and use the proposed language as a living
                one, and not only in last extremities, and with the key at hand."</li>
        </ol>
