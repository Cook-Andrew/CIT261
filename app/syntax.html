<p>Word order in Esperanto is flexible beause the object of a sentence often ends in the suffix -n. The word order of a
    sentence almost always matches English, but if the words are mixed up the meaning is still clear. This is why you
    cant use passive voice. Instead of saying "The road was crossed by the chicken.", you can say "The road(n) crossed the
    chicken" and still be clear that the chicken is the subject of the sentence and the road is the object. Sentences
    don't always use accusative case, but for the purposes of the quiz always use "-n". Remember punctuation!</p>
